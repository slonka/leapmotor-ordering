I want to create a website where you can order electric leapmotor cars (https://www.leapmotor.net/leapmotor-models) first focus on T03 and leave the rest grayed out. I'm going to pitch this website to the owner
of leapmotor golemo Krakow (https://www.golemo.pl/leapmotor/). The first step of this picker should be picking the model. Use a transparent (or white) bg picture like this one (t03 -

https://lpwebsite-prod-s3cdn.leapmotor-international.com/public/en-cms/1758705031302BodyColorsGlazedGreen.png). Make b10 and c10 grayed out and something like "coming soon" - we're focusing on t03.

Then on the next step you pick the color available (Light White, Caribbean Blue, Canopy Grey).

Then you can pick extra accessories like: car mats (rubber, welurowe), winter tyres.

Then you pick if you're buying as a company or as a individual person.

If personal then you have personal info like name, surname, PESEL, address, phone, email. You can add co-owners.
If company then name & surname of the representative of the company, nip and address and everything autofills from some public db, then phone, email.

Then you pick financing options, they are described in file:///private/tmp/1769444221585Cennik_T03_MY26_RP26_26.01.2026.pdf

Then you have an option to actually just "request contact" or you put in your card information and you actually place the order. Let's have a button (just for the demo) like "example card info" and let's also make it look like a real transaction (so validate if it's visa / mastercard / whatever).

Design this as a responsive website so it works both on mobile and on a laptop.
